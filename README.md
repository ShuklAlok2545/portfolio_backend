## 🛠️ Backend Description

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, acting as the server for handling API requests and managing dynamic content. MongoDB is used as the database to store project details, messages from the contact form, and other relevant data. The backend ensures proper routing, error handling, and secure communication with the frontend. It exposes RESTful endpoints that allow the frontend to fetch and display data in real-time.
